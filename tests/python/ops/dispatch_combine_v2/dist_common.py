"""torchrun-based bootstrap for the cco dispatch/combine tests (no MPI).

cco itself only needs (nranks, rank, unique_id); MPI was just the courier for
the uid and for test-only allgathers. Here we use torch.distributed (gloo, CPU)
purely as that courier, driven by torchrun's RANK/WORLD_SIZE/LOCAL_RANK env.
