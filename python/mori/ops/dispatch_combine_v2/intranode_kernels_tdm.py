"""TDM-transported intranode EP dispatch (gfx1250), a FlyDSL port of mori's
``src/ops/dispatch_combine_v2/ep_intranode_1250x.hpp``.

The sibling ``intranode_kernels.make_dispatch`` gives one whole wave to one
(token, expert-slot) route: the wave takes a remote atomic for the recv slot,
then copies the token with 16-byte per-lane stores. That shape is what a machine
without a DMA engine wants. It is the wrong shape for gfx1250, where the Tensor
Data Mover moves a whole row on one descriptor: the copy stops needing lanes at
all, so the per-route remote atomic and the scattered 4-byte metadata stores --
previously hidden under the payload copy -- become the cost.

So this kernel keeps mori's restructuring rather than bolting TDM onto the
existing one. Three things change, and they only pay off together:

  * a route is one LANE, not one wave (``WAVE / topk`` tokens per wave), so a
    wave sees all of a token's routes at once and can dedup same-peer routes
    against each other with a permute instead of a ballot per route;
  * the recv slots for a whole BLOCK are reserved with one remote atomic per
    (block, peer) instead of one per route, off an LDS histogram;
  * idx / weights / srcmap are gathered into a block-local, destination-ordered
    staging array first, so the cross-GPU metadata write is a handful of bulk
    TDM runs instead of thousands of scattered dwords.

Everything downstream (``tok_map`` encoding, the grid barrier, the per-peer
count signal, the self-resetting counters) is bit-compatible with
``make_dispatch``, so combine, replay and the op layer are unchanged.

Not ported: scales, fp4, push-group and replay. They are orthogonal to the
transport and each one needs its own staging region; ``make_dispatch`` still
owns those paths.
