"""gfx1250 TDM (Tensor Data Mover) descriptors over RAW 64-bit addresses.

``flydsl.expr.rocdl.tdm_ops.make_tensor_descriptor_2d`` derives the descriptor's
global base from a fly memref/tensor. The EP dispatch path cannot use it: the
destination of a payload move is a *peer's* copy of a symmetric region, i.e. the
integer ``cco.Window(h).lsa_ptr(pe, off)``, which is a runtime value and not a
kernel tensor argument. So GROUP0 is packed here by hand from an i64 address and
an LDS byte address, and GROUP1 from the compile-time tile geometry.

The bit layout is copied from ``make_tensor_descriptor_2d`` and must track it:

  GROUP0 (vector<4xi32>)   lane0 pred | lane1 lds byte addr | lane2/3 global lo/hi
                           (lane3 bit31 = descriptor type field)
  GROUP1 (vector<8xi32>)   s0 data_size[17:16] and the pad/mcast bits we leave 0
                           s1 tensor_dim0[15:0] << 16
                           s2 tensor_dim0[31:16] | tensor_dim1[15:0] << 16
                           s3 tensor_dim1[31:16] | tile_dim0 << 16
                           s4 tile_dim1[15:0]
                           s5 tensor_dim0_stride[31:0]
                           s6 tensor_dim0_stride[47:32] | tensor_dim1_stride[15:0] << 16
                           s7 tensor_dim1_stride[31:16]

dim0 is the innermost (contiguous) extent and dim1 the number of rows, matching
the ISA convention -- note ``s5`` is called ``tensor_dim0_stride`` in the ISA but
is the stride *between rows*, i.e. flydsl's ``outer_stride``.

``tensor_dim1_stride`` is set to ``dim1``, which is what every one of mori's
three descriptor builders does (``TdmShape`` 1 for its 1 x hiddenDim payload,
``TdmShape2D`` dim1, ``TdmShapeGather`` nRows). flydsl's
``make_tensor_descriptor_2d`` instead leaves s6/s7 zero as "no higher-dim
strides"; that holds for its own tiles, which are always dim1 >= 2, but a
``dim1 == 1`` descriptor with a zero dim1 stride hangs the TDM engine. mori's
own note on the subject is that "gfx1250 has no 1xN wedge, while the payload has
always sent 1 x hiddenDim" -- the reconciliation is this field.

Setting tensor_dim == tile_dim is flydsl's "OOB checking off" encoding: the
caller guarantees the run is in bounds. This module never enables padding, the
atomic barrier, or multicast; all three change the transfer protocol and none
are wanted for a point-to-point copy.
